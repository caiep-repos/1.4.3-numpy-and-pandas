# Pandas DataFrame Manipulation

## Problem Description

In this assignment, you will use the pandas library to create and manipulate a DataFrame. You will perform tasks such as creating a DataFrame from a dictionary, selecting rows based on a condition, and calculating the average value of a column.

## Learning Objectives

- Create a pandas DataFrame from a dictionary.
- Select data from a DataFrame based on a condition.
- Perform calculations on DataFrame columns.

## Setup Instructions

1.  Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Instructions

1.  Open the `assignment.py` file.
2.  You will find three function definitions: `create_dataframe`, `select_young_people`, and `calculate_average_age`.
3.  Your tasks are to:
    *   **Task 1**: Implement the `create_dataframe` function to create a pandas DataFrame from the given dictionary.
    *   **Task 2**: Implement the `select_young_people` function to select rows where the 'age' is less than 30.
    *   **Task 3**: Implement the `calculate_average_age` function to calculate the average age from the DataFrame.

## Testing Your Solution

Run the test file to verify your implementation:

```bash
python test.py
```
